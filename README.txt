Mirror Machine Learning:
It is a Machine learning project that classify Different Glass according to their properties.
How to get started:
Load n1.m or n2.m in Matlab editor. n1.m uses k nearest neighbor to classify the dataset that is provided in train.txt. n2.m uses Decision tree Algorithm to classify the dataset.
The file test.txt contains testing data and the file train.m contains training data. The Output of the result is provided in Output1.csv file by running n1.m and the Output of the result is provided in Output2.csv file by running n2.m
The dataset is taken from UCI Repository. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/glass+identification.
